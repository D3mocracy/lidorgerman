# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Lidor**, a 23-year-old full-stack developer from 🇮🇱 Israel. I build cool things using **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, and **Java** — and occasionally dive into product ideas that (hopefully) make life a little easier or more interesting.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

```js
console.log("Hey, Whassup?");
```

- I mostly code in **TypeScript**, and yes — I know people love to hate on JavaScript. But if I mastered Hebrew by age 3, JS is manageable.
- On the **backend**, I’m all about **Node.js**. For the **frontend**, it’s mostly **React**.
- Recently, I've been getting into **React Native** and **Flutter**.
